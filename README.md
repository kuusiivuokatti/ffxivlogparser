#### About

A log parser with the aim to make the FFXIV character logs more human readable. Meant to read logs that are by default stored in Documents\My Games\FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn, where each character has its own FFXIV_CHR folder. These logs are not suitable for reliable battle data parsing.

#### Documentation

More detailed documentation about the project can be found in the doc folder.

2. [code](doc/code.md) contains information about the code structure
